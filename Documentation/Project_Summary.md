# Project Summary

## Problem Statement
Visually impaired individuals face challenges in navigation and object recognition. Traditional aids like white canes have limitations in detecting obstacles beyond immediate proximity.

## Solution
Smart Vision Glasses that:
- Detect objects in real-time using computer vision
- Provide audio feedback to the user
- Are portable, affordable, and efficient
- Work without internet connectivity

## Technical Implementation
- Hardware: ESP32-CAM, Arduino Uno, 5V battery
- Software: YOLOv8 object detection, Streamlit dashboard
- Connectivity: WiFi for video streaming

## Impact
- Enhanced mobility and independence for visually impaired users
- Improved safety through obstacle detection
- Cost-effective solution compared to existing alternatives
